          <h2>From a New York Times obit on David Foster Wallace:</h2>

          <h3 class="article-title">The Best Mind of His Generation</h3>
          <p class="article-author">By A.O. Scott</p>
          <p class="article-date">Sept. 20, 2008</p>
          <p>
            Mr. Wallace was the kind of literary figure whose career was
            emblematic of his age. He may not have been the most famous novelist
            of his time, but more than anyone else, he exemplified and
            articulated the defining anxieties and attitudes of his generation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Wallace's vibrant body of work—reportage and criticism as well
            as two novels and three volumes of shorter fiction—pursued themes
            that in retrospect look uncomfortably like portents. His last book
            of stories was called “Oblivion,” and an earlier collection included
            the stories “Death Is Not the End,” “Suicide as a Sort of Present”
            and “The Depressed Person.” Even his most exuberant explorations of
            absurdity are edged with melancholy. “Infinite Jest,” the enormous,
            zeitgeist-gobbling novel that set his generation's benchmark for
            literary ambition, is, for all its humor, an encyclopedia of phobia,
            anxiety, compulsion and mania.
          </p>

          <p>
            The moods that Mr. Wallace distilled so vividly on the page—the
            gradations of sadness and madness embedded in the obsessive,
            recursive, exhausting prose style that characterized both his
            journalism and his fiction—crystallized an unhappy collective
            consciousness. And it came through most vividly in his voice.
            Hyperarticulate, plaintive, self-mocking, diffident, overbearing,
            needy, ironical, almost pathologically self-aware (and nearly
            impossible to quote in increments smaller than a thousand words)—it
            was something you instantly recognized even hearing it for the first
            time. It was—is—the voice in your own head.
          </p>

            The really important kind of freedom involves attention and
            awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other
            people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty,
            unsexy ways every day. That is real freedom. That is being educated,
            and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness,
            the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of
            having had, and lost, some infinite thing.

            What goes on inside is just too fast and huge and all interconnected
            for words to do more than barely sketch the outlines of at most one
            tiny little part of it at any given instant.

            Am I a good person? Deep down, do I even really want to be a good
            person, or do I only want to seem like a good person so that people
            (including myself) will approve of me? Is there a difference? How do
            I ever actually know whether I'm bullshitting myself, morally
            speaking?

            Because here’s something else that’s weird but true: in the day-to
            day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as
            atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody
            worships. The only choice we get is what to worship.

            What passes for hip cynical transcendence of sentiment is really
            some kind of fear of being really human, since to be really human
            [...] is probably to be unavoidably sentimental and naïve and
            goo-prone and generally pathetic.

            Fiction is one of the few experiences where loneliness can be both
            confronted and relieved. Drugs, movies where stuff blows up, loud
            parties — all these chase away loneliness by making me forget my
            name's Dave and I live in a one-by-one box of bone no other party
            can penetrate or know. Fiction, poetry, music, really deep serious
            sex, and, in various ways, religion — these are the places (for me)
            where loneliness is countenanced, stared down, transfigured,
            treated.

            A U. S. of modern A. where the State is not a team or a code, but a
            sort of sloppy intersection of desires and fears, where the only
            public consensus a boy must surrender to is the acknowledged primacy
            of straight-line pursuing this flat and short-sighted idea of
            personal happiness.

            If you are bored and disgusted by politics and don't bother to vote,
            you are in effect voting for the entrenched Establishments of the
            two major parties, who please rest assured are not dumb, and who are
            keenly aware that it is in their interests to keep you disgusted and
            bored and cynical and to give you every possible reason to stay at
            home doing one-hitters and watching MTV on primary day. By all means
            stay home if you want, but don't bullshit yourself that you're not
            voting. In reality, there is no such thing as not voting: you either
            vote by voting, or you vote by staying home and tacitly doubling the
            value of some Diehard's vote.

            The so-called 'psychotically depressed' person who tries to kill
            herself doesn't do so out of quote 'hopelessness' or any abstract
            conviction that life's assets and debits do not square. And surely
            not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its
            invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill
            herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the
            window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap
            from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is
            still just as great as it would be for you or me standing
            speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e.
            the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the
            other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough,
            falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors.
            It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. And yet
            nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling 'Don't!' and
            'Hang on!', can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have
            personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a
            terror way beyond falling.
